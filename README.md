# PySR-for-Stellar-AM-and-Luminosity
A mathematical relation of the temperature, radius and luminosity with the Absolute Magnitude of a given star is derived using PySR library. Instead of building deep neural networks or complex ML algorithms, PySR simply tries to built mathematical expressions that best describe the relationship between variables in a dataset.
